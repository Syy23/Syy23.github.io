In all, I didn't do well in this week actually. The only thing that I do is finishing a paper "A survey on deep learning based face recognition".

The paper have described almost everything about face recognition using ML method. I believe that I have a macro understanding about face recognition now. At the same time, I find that it's not an easy problem to combine NIS and VIS image. There is sufficient value researching on it. 

Another thing is that traditional method on face detection seems being forgotten. It's hard to find a paper about it in 5 years. I don't know if I still need to read about it, so I will do the ML part first. 

The most important task I need to do now is to collect different kinds of models. Find out which model I can use in the future.

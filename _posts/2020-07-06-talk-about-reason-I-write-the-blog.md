Blogging is a cool thing to me. It was four years ago that I first heard my classmate was blogging online. This raised my curiosity. He was a tech-man who knew a lot about computer science and machine things. I believed there were lots of thing I could learn from him. 

However, when I learned more about blogging, I found that it was not an easy thing. This is why I start to do it now, not four years before. 

I will record papers I read and projects I am doing in this blog. Hope that I will keep blogging for a long long time.
